## Review Questions

### 1. **Why do we use classes?**
Classes in programming help:
- Organize code by grouping data and functions.
- Encapsulate data and behavior within objects.
- Promote code reuse and hierarchy through inheritance.

### 2. **Difference between an Object and a Dictionary:**
- **Object:** An instance of a class, combining data and behavior.
- **Dictionary:** A built-in data structure for key-value pairs.

### 3. **Notation for Objects:**
In Python, objects are created from classes using constructor notation:
```python
object = Class()
```

### 4. **Difference between a Method and a Function:**
- **Function:** A standalone block of code.
- **Method:** A function associated with a class or object, operating on class-specific data.
