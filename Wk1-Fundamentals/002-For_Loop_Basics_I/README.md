# For Loop Basics

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various for loop algorithms. Each script focuses on a specific task, and below an overview is provided of what each script does, along with explanations.

### 1. Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.
   - **Description:** This loop prints integers from 0 to 150 inclusively.
   - **Purpose:** Illustrates the basic usage of a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers.

### 2. Multiples of 5
   - **Description:** This loop prints multiples of 5 from 5 to 1000 inclusively.
   - **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to use a for loop with a step value to print specific numbers in a range.

### 3. Counting, the Dojo Way
- **Description:** This loop prints integers from 1 to 100.
- **Conditions:**
    - If an integer is divisible by 5, it prints "Coding" instead.
    - If an integer is divisible by 10, it prints "Coding Dojo" instead.
- **Purpose:** Shows how to use conditional statements within a for loop to modify the output based on divisibility.

### 4. Whoa. That Sucker's Huge
- **Description:** This loop adds all odd integers from 0 to 500,000 and prints the final sum.
- **Purpose:** Illustrates the use of a for loop to perform cumulative addition.

### 5. Countdown by Fours
- **Description:** This loop prints positive numbers starting at 2018 and counts down by fours.
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to use a for loop with a decreasing step value.

### 6. Flexible Counter
- **Description:** This loop is configurable with three variables: `lowNum`, `highNum`, and `mult`.
- **Purpose:** Provides flexibility by allowing you to set the range and the multiple condition for printing integers.
- **Example:**
    - If `lowNum` is 2, `highNum` is 9, and `mult` is 3, the loop will print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines).
